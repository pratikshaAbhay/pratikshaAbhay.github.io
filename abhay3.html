<p1 style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:130%"><b>1. you're irreplaceable</b><br>i've made a lot of friends. i've seen a dozen of beautiful people. but there's something about you that makes you feel like a home and an escape at the same time.i am gonna find more friends in life,go maybe a 1000miles away from you but i know in my heart that you'll always be the idiot that i'll come cribbing to. also just saying i don't care how much you judge me for being a crybaby. (fyi i am not a crybaby) i can't begin to explain how annoying it is when you don't pick up calls or reply to texts and yet there's no one i would want to call about 10 times at one go. So basically all i am trying to say is that you are stuck with me for life, also you don't really have an option</p>


<p2 style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:110%"><b>2.you hold the potential of doing amazing things</b><br>ofcourse you know your worth.but a little reminder once in a while won't hurt, right? there are so many talents that you hold and a passion to make it big in life i and the whole world believes in you. i am not going to give you motivational speeches more so because that's your role but still this is a reminder that i believe in you, in everything that you wish for. i hope to meet you years down the line,in your huge, palace like home(please keep your gazillion dobermans or whatever away from me)and that's the time you return all my RB roll treats, okay? let yourself breathe and be your best version. i will always root for you<br><br></p2>


<p3 style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:110%"><b>3.you can let your heart out at times</b><br>i hear you that you don't have 'bt' in your life but that doesn't take away the fact that you are low sometimes and it's absolutely okay to call someone and let your heart out, say things that are too heavy to deal with. your emotions are as important as the next person, you've been there for people, i know that and i see that, and now let people be there for you, idiot. dare you ever hide anything from me under the reason of 'i don't want to be emo and dramatic',it is not emo and definitely not dramatic, dumbass.<br><br></p3>


<p4 style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:110%"><b>4.you are my go-to reality check person</b><br>there are a ton of people who can console me, tell me that things will be fine and support me but you saying things is different and necessary. you throw reality at my face, tell me what i NEED to hear and not something i WANT to. you don't really do anything to solve my problems you just stand there, give me one of the most honest opinions and that's all<br><br></p4>


<p5 style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:110%"><b>5.you annoy me (a lot)</b><br>oh boy, i could literally ramble on about this you saying hmmm, you knowning exactly how to piss me off, you not picking up my calls, just in general you are an annoying ass that i never want to lose in my life :)</p5>
